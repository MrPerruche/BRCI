BASICS OF BRCI
==============

This document covers essential concepts for BRCI usage, helping you get started and pick up best practices.


Setting up BRCI
---------------

BRCI supports the following versions of Brick Rigs files:

- Version ``14`` for Brick Rigs 1.7 - 1.7.4
- We plan to support any upcoming file version aswell as Version ``6`` (latest legacy version)

BRCI follows the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), where each file version is represented by a specific
class. These classes are named according to the version of the Brick Rigs file they work with. For example:

- ``brci.Creation14`` for Brick Rigs version 14
- ``brci.Creation15`` for Brick Rigs version 15 (has yet to be released)
- ``brci.Creation6`` for Brick Rigs version 6 (not supported yet)

When initializing BRCI, you need to create an instance of the appropriate class based on the version of the Brick Rigs
file you're working with. For type hinting, the generic brci.Creation class is available, but when creating the instance
you must specify the version of the Brick Rigs file (e.g., ``brci.Creation14()``).

To initialize an instance, two arguments are required: ``project_name`` and ``project_dir``.
These define the location where your Brick Rigs files are created. For example, if ``project_name`` is ``'my_vehicle'``
and ``project_dir`` is ``'C:\\my_script\\Projects'``, the files will be created in the
``C:\\my_script\\Projects\\my_vehicle`` directory. These variables can be modified at any time.

BRCI provides several predefined paths options that you can choose, that could help you especially if you are
inexperienced. Paths marked with an asterix (*) are not recommended if BRCI was installed using pip. They are:

- \* ``brci.BRCI_CWD``: Current Working Directory of BRCI.
- ``brci.BRICK_RIGS_FOLDER``: List of paths where Brick Rigs vehicle files *could* be stored.
- \* ``brci.PROJECT_FOLDER``: Folder included in BRCI for storing projects.
- \* ``brci.BACKUP_FOLDER``: Folder included in BRCI for storing backups.

**Example of initializing BRCI:**

.. code-block:: python

  import brci

  creation: brci.Creation = brci.Creation14(  # Creates a Creation object
      project_name='my_vehicle',  # Set the name of the folder all files will be created in.
                                  # Files must be stored in (project dir)\(project name) folder
      project_dir=brci.PROJECT_FOLDER
  )

Creation classes can take a lot more arguments:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 20 80

  * - ``brci.Creation15``, ``brci.Creation14``
    - - ``project_name`` (``str``): Folder name.
      - ``project_dir`` (``str``): Directory.
      - ``name`` (``str``): Display name.
      - ``description`` (``str``): Description.
      - ``appendix`` (``bytes | bytearray``): Hidden binary data.
      - ``tags`` (``list[str] | None``): List of tags.
      - ``visibility`` (``int``): Visibility.
      - ``seat`` (``Optional[str | int]``): Name of the driver seat.
      - ``creation_time`` (``Optional[int]``): Time of creation.
      - ``update_time`` (``Optional[int]``): Time of last update.
      - ``size`` (``Optional[list[float]]``): Size of the project (meters).
      - ``weight`` (``float``): Weight of the project (kilograms).
      - ``price`` (``float``): Price of the project (dollars).

All arguments can be directly modified post-initialization.


Building with BRCI
------------------

To place bricks in our build, we use 3 methods or classes:

- ``brci.Brick<version>``: Brick class itself
- ``brci.Creation<version>.Brick()``: Returns the provided brick with the same version as the creation class. Common to
  all creation classes.
- ``brci.Creation<version>.add_brick()``: Directly adds a newly created brick to the creation's brick list

These 3 methods or classes all take the same arguments:

- ``brick_type`` (``str``): Type of the brick. e.g ``'ScalableCone'``.
- ``name`` (``str | int``): Name of the brick.
- ``position`` (``Optional[list[float]]``): Position of the brick.
- ``rotation`` (``Optional[list[float]]``): Rotation of the brick.
- ``properties`` (``Optional[dict[str, Any]]``): Properties of the brick.

All arguments can be directly modified post-initialization except for ``brick_type``. To modify it, use the method
``.set_type(new_type: str)`` and accessed it with ``.get_type()``.

If bricks are not directly created using the ``add_brick`` method, they can be added to the creation instance by
modifying the ``.bricks`` attribute. This is a list of ``brci.Brick<version>`` objects, and you can use methods like
``.append()`` or ``.extend()`` to add new bricks.

BRCI features many functions to help you build your creation, from (TODO)

Once the creation built, to write the creation file (``Vehicle.brv``) we use the ``.write_creation()`` method.
It takes 3 arguments:

- ``filename`` (``str``): Name of the file to write.
- ``exist_ok`` (``bool``): Overwrite the file if it already exists, raises an error if set to ``False``.

A creation cannot work properly without adding a metadata file (``Metadata.brm``) in the same directory.
To create one, use the ``brci.Creation<version>.write_metadata()`` method.
The ``.write_metadata()`` method takes as values the instance's attributes.
Therefore it takes the same arguments as ``brci.Creation<version>.write_creation()``

**Example of building with BRCI:**

.. code-block:: python

  import brci
  import random

  # Create a Creation object
  creation: brci.Creation = brci.Creation14(
      project_name='my_vehicle',
      project_dir=brci.PROJECT_FOLDER
  )

  # Add 5 bricks:
  for i in range(5):
      creation.add_brick(  # Adds brick
          'ScalableCone',  # Set the brick type to scalable cones
          f'Random_scalable_{i}',  # Sets the name
          position=brci.pos([random.uniform(0, 10) for _ in range(3)]),  # Sets the position to 3 random number between 0 and 10 meters on each axis
          rotation=[random.uniform(-180, 180) for _ in range(3)],  # Sets the rotation to 3 random number between -180 and 180 degrees on each axis
          properties={  # Sets the brick's properties. For more info on each brick's property names, see bricks14.rst.
              "BrickSize": [brci.size(random.uniform(10, 20), brci.Units.CENTIMETERS) for _ in range(3)],  # Give it a random size between 10 and 20 centimeters on each axis
          }
      )

  creation.write_creation(exist_ok=True)  # Create the Vehicle.brv file, overwriting if required
  creation.write_metadata(exist_ok=True)  # Create the Metadata.brm file, overwriting if required
