### More details and how to use


Note: There appears to be some confusion around what BRCI is.
Unlike most content in #maps-and-mods-uploads, this is a library (not a program nor a regular mod) written in python.
As such, to use it, python knowledge is required.

As there also appears to be some confusion as to how to set it up, here's a guide on how to set it up:

- Create a new python project.
- Download BRCI by clicking on `Code` then `Download Zip`.
- Unzip it in the same directory as your python file.
- Rename `BRCI-main` or whatever name the folder was given to `BRCI`.
- In your python file, import BRCI (preferably using `import BRCI as brci`) and use it.
- Follow remaining instructions in `Doc\DOCUMENTATION.md`.

NumPy is a dependency of BRCI.
If you do not have NumPy installed in your environment or Python installation, certain functionality will be disabled to prevent errors.
Install NumPy with `pip install numpy`, or use the requirements file with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
